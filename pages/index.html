This site hosts some of the games we've developed, mostly for game jams such as
<a href="https://ldjam.com">Ludum Dare</a>. For the most part, these games have
been developed over the course of a single weekend with a team of three or four
developers. In the future, we may also host larger projects if we ever get
around to completing any. We hope you enjoy playing our games!
