<p>
We're a small team of hobbyist game developers who like to participate in game
jams, particularly <a href="www.ldjam.com">Ludum Dare</a>. We make games in just
about anything, including Processing, Game Maker, and Unity. This site hosts
some of our favourite game jam entries. In the future, it may host larger
projects, if we ever get around to completing any.
